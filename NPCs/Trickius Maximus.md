### 🍻 Location: _Ye Olde Barbes_

A mismatched, graffiti-plastered drinking den just outside the castle walls. Candlelight flickers against stickers and bloodstains. Spilled mead, secondhand vape smoke, someone always sound-checking but never performing.

It’s the **only** place where:

- Vapes don’t explode on impact
    
- Gorp gremlins can drink half-price
    
- Tricjius might drop an improvised bar that rewrites your fate

### 🎭 Bardic Features

#### 🎙 _Words of Terror_

- Speak to a creature for 1 minute → they must WIS save (DC 15) or be **frightened** of _everything you represent_ for 1 hour.
    

> “I spit truths like acid — drips off your ego, burns through your pride.”

#### 🤐 _Psychic Blades_

- Turn your cutting words into literal psychic damage
    
- When you land a hit, deal +2d6 psychic dmg (5d6 at level 7)
    
- Often sounds like:
    
    > “Oi... your soul’s out of tune, mate. Let me fix that — with rhythm.”
    

#### 🎭 _Mantle of Whispers_

- Steal someone’s identity when they die. Literally. Gain their voice, memories, and appearance.
    
- Great for infiltration… or _surprise collabs._

- _Silence_ (drops mid-verse, makes the beat hit _so_ hard)

### 🐍 Personality

- **Charismatic, filthy, wise.** A poet born in bin smoke and beer foam.
    
- Loves to **talk in verse**, especially when serious.
    

> “Don’t tell me about fate, mate. I seen gods cry and drummers ghost their own beat.”

- Sometimes weirdly prophetic, especially when drunk.
    
- Loyalty runs deep — protectors of misfits, outcasts, and “those still finding their verse.”

### 🎤 Sample Dialogue

> “Ye Olde Barbes ain't just a tavern. It’s a chapel of chaos, and I'm your scaly preacher.”  
> “I don't trust no king who ain't bombed on stage before.”  
> “Every scar’s a syllable. Every bruise — a beat.”

### 📦 Tavern Loot / Secrets

- **Mic of Muffled Madness**: A war-torn arcane microphone that casts _Confusion_ once per long rest when dropped.
    
- **Bar Tab Ledger of Fate**: A cursed bar tab book. Writing your name in it links your soul to the bar — but also gives you **+1 AC while inside.**
    
- **Tricjius’ Mixtape** (unreleased): Plays 3 tracks — each triggers a different spell: _Calm Emotions_, _Fear_, or _Legend Lore_ (on the beat drop only).
