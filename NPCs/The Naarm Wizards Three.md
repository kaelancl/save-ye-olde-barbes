### 📍Backstory

Mave Ferrix is a Naarm-based enchanter who hosts spell theory salons in rooftop herb gardens, does divination with coffee grounds, and speaks at protests in _between_ brunch and tarot gigs. They’re deeply invested in community-building, but they also benefit from their social clout — and have a blind spot when it comes to the marginalised _gorp gremlins_ who serve the party scene they thrive in.

They mean well. But they might say things like:

> "Gorp gremlins are kind of adorable in their own way. Like… _scrappy_. You know? Wild little things. I love that for them."

Underneath their charm and charisma lies a person navigating the tension between social privilege and progressive ideals.

### 💋 Roleplay Guide

- **Welcoming to everyone**, unless you give off bad vibes — then they go cool and condescending fast.
    
- Loves to draw people out by asking oddly specific personal questions like, “If your heartbreak was a spell, what school of magic would it be?”
    
- Flirts through spellcraft: winks while casting, sends little messages through Mage Hand strokes, or changes eye color mid-conversation.
    
- **Ethically messy**: Their stance on the gorp gremlins is a little _liberal-arts-complicated_. They’ll say things like:
    
    > “Look, I support gremlin inclusion — absolutely. But they keep crawling into the sound booth and hissing at DJs, it’s… disruptive, right?”
    

Players can challenge this. If they do, and make a **Persuasion** or **Insight** check > 17, Mave will _hesitate_, reflect, and even apologize:

> “Shit… yeah, no. You’re right. That was a trash take. Thank you for calling me out — seriously.”
