## 🌀🎞 **Oracle Jax of the Infinite Scene**

**Pronouns:** they/he  
**Race:** Tiefling (Radiant bloodline — their eyes are literally projector lenses)  
**Class:** Oracle (Homebrew Sorcerer/Divination hybrid)  
**Alignment:** True Vibe Neutral  
**Location:** Found loitering in quiet laneways, rooftop cinemas, abandoned stairwells, and places _just before_ they become popular.

### 🌃 Overview

Jax doesn’t see the _future_, exactly — they see _**where it will happen first.**_ Whether it’s a warehouse party, a sonic baptism, or a speakeasy with mushroom-infused fog and ice sculptures of endangered fauna, **they know where the scene is.** Before it exists. Before it’s cool. Always.

They dress like a glitch between eras: part 1920s film critic, part '90s Berlin raver, part neon ghost.

### 💘 Updated Vibe Profile

Jax’s sapphic energy isn’t just present — it’s _cinematic_. It lingers in the air like rose incense and slow-burning eye contact. Everyone — men, women, anyone in between — feels slightly flustered around them, but _**the girls**_? The girls are _levitating_.

They talk with a knowing, low-tone drawl. They read poetry out loud when you didn’t ask. They once slow-danced with a druid under a glitching disco ball and neither of them spoke for 36 hours afterward.

> “Your aura is giving _blooming nightshade in a glass of vermouth._ I mean that in a _very_ good way.”

Their idea of flirting is referencing a 1973 lesbian French horror film, _**that you haven’t seen**_, while adjusting the collar of your coat and saying _"you look like the tragic lead."_

### 📖 Personality

- Speaks only in riddles, obscure film references, and uncanny allusions.
    
- Carries an old View-Master toy that they peer into to “see” the scene.
    
- Says things like:
    
    > “It’s like _Sympathy for Lady Vengeance_, but scored by early Arca. Bring a raincoat.”  
    > “The threshold appears only to those who arrive late — but not _too_ late. Like _Jean-Pierre_, in _Night Rites: Vol 3_, obviously.”  
    > “You’re not ready for the scene yet… but the scene is _already waiting for you_.”

### 💄 Roleplay Touchstones

- **Flirt style:** Languid. Smirking. Warm and dangerous. Often says things like:
    
    > “If we survive this, let’s share a cigarette and pretend we don’t know what it meant.”  
    > “You remind me of her — but softer. Better. Maybe it ends differently this time.”
    
- **Body Language:** Leans in close when talking. Makes confident but never threatening eye contact. Smells faintly of sandalwood and print toner.
    
- **Queer-coded habits:** Recommends films with deeply buried sapphic subtext, then makes direct eye contact until _you_ mention it.

### 🧙 Mechanics Add-On

#### 💘 _Unspoken Chemistry (1/day)_

Once per long rest, if Jax is speaking to a femme-presenting character (PC or NPC), they can cause the target to make a **DC 15 WIS save** or become **charmed** for 1 hour, convinced that Jax is someone from a dream they half-remember.

- If they succeed the save, they still leave the conversation feeling slightly dazed and writing poetry later that night.

### 🌈 How the Party Sees Them

- The **bard** is jealous of their natural charisma.
    
- The **paladin** is flustered every time Jax compliments their armor.
    
- The **ranger** once asked them “what we are” after Jax gave them a poem.
    
- The **sorcerer** is both obsessed and confused.
    
- Even the **rogue** who “doesn’t do feelings” lingers a little longer when Jax is near.

### 🌀 Abilities

#### 🎞 _Clairscene (Recharge 5–6)_

Jax can “preview” a location or social hotspot 1d6 hours into the future.

- Mechanically functions as **Legend Lore** + **Divination**, but only about _**events, vibes, or trends.**_
    
- Gives poetic, indirect visions of what’s going to happen. Sometimes accurate. Always stylized.
    

#### 🃏 _Oracle’s Cut_

Once per long rest, Jax may **edit reality** like a director:

- Choose one event (a failed roll, a missed scene, a lost item).
    
- _**“Rewind and cut it differently.”**_
    
- The event replays with advantage, or is replaced by a thematically appropriate alternative.
    

> “No, no, that wasn’t the right arc for you. Let's reshoot.”

#### 📼 _Obscure Reference (Cantrip)_

Can speak the name of a film, band, or scene no one else has ever heard of. Anyone who **fails a DC 14 Insight save** takes **1d4 psychic damage** from the _**pressure to pretend they understand.**_

- Works even on enemies.
