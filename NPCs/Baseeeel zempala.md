### 🎭 Personality

- **Obsessive:** Can name every item in his collection and becomes anxious if anything is missing.
    
- **Eccentric:** Speaks in fast, hushed tones like someone always in the middle of a brilliant but private conversation.
    
- **Paranoid:** Booby-traps his hoard and trusts no one except “Lady Hissblade,” a broken shortsword he talks to.
    
- **Surprisingly Clever:** Despite his madness, he’s an expert on metallurgy and enchantment.
    

**Quirks:**

- Refers to his weapons as children.
    
- Constantly polishes something, even during tense moments.
    
- Will barter only with weapons — coins are an insult.

### 💬 Sample Dialogue

- “Ahhh, yes yes yes, _this_ beauty? Tempered in the blood of a basilisk — _probably_. Yours for a blade that’s seen _at least_ three duels and a betrayal.”
    
- “Touch nothing! Nothing! They get jealous. You don’t want _Whistler_ waking up again, do you?”
    
- “Baseeel’s Vault is _not_ a shop. It’s a shrine. But... what’s your offer?”

### 🛡️ Role in the One-Shot

- **A quest-giver** who offers rare weapons in exchange for collecting dangerous cursed items.
    
- **A gatekeeper** NPC who won’t allow passage until a proper weapon “tribute” is offered.
    
- **A wild card** — if the players loot him, he might unleash a sentient weapon or go full _Home Alone_ with traps.
    
- **Comic relief** who turns out to know critical knowledge from an old war weapon he once stole.
