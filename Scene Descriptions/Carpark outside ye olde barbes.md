You swing open the warped wooden door of **Ye Olde Barbes**, the distorted mumbles of Trickius Maximus practicing new verses fading behind you — half a verse still echoing off the graffiti-slicked alley walls.

Outside, the **cobblestone laneway is misty with smoke**. A Neon open signs flickers intermittently above the tavern, if you look closer you can see that it is run by a swarm of glow worms. 

As you step out into the night to begin your noble mission — to peddle your potent Dragon Dust down at _Hyde Park Square Markets_ — you discover that your path is blocked by a gang of _**Eshay Elves**_.

### 👟 **Description: The Eshay Elves**

There’s _**eight of them**_. All lean, wiry, twitchy. Elven ears poking through mullets and designer knockoff hoods. One’s doing sick magic boosted tail whips on a Razor scooter, a glowing mist allowing the scooter to hover above the ground to maximise air time. Another tagging an elvish glyph on the wall.

They puff on shimmering crystalline vapes — clouds that smell of foresteen mango ice . Every few puffs, they **cough violently**. One doubles over.

They click their tongues. Spit on the ground. One flips open a butterfly knife and spins it with ill-advised flourish.

> **"Oi you's. What’s in ya satchel?"**  
> **"Yous think you can sling on _our_ turf?"**  

You’ve stumbled straight into a _**shifty turf-check ambush**_.

### 🧪 Mechanics (Optional)

- **Initiative starts immediately** if the party acts cocky, suspicious, or flashes any dragon dust.
    
- If they try to talk: DC 15 Persuasion to avoid a shanking.
    
- **Combat note:** Each Eshay Elf has a **"Cough Counter"** — after every 2 rounds, they lose 5 HP from _**respiratory failure**_ due to long-term vape exposure.
    
- One of them yells **“Shift it!”** every round as a bonus action and teleports 5 feet in a random direction, throwing off targeting.

### 🗣 Flavor Lines

    
- “My cousin’s a Wild Sorcerer bro, don’t _**test me.**_”

### 🎁 Outcome Possibilities

- **Win the fight?** They drop enchanted butterfly knives, off-brand enchanted vape rigs, and a scroll written in Elvish full of mad rhymes.
    
- **Talk your way out?** They might let you through... if you _**rap battle**_ them, offer them a bump, or beat them in a vape-trick contest (CON check contest).
