Lurking in the dark alleyways of downtown fitzroy garage party 

# 🐀💅 **Naarm-Core Gorp Gremlin**

_"Ugh... you probably haven't even heard of the label."_

A chaotic, fashion-forward alley cryptid. Drawn to overpriced baggy cargos, $200 beanies, and the scent of White Claw and elitist nihilism. It lurks around **Fitzroy garage parties**, draining confidence and self-worth with passive-aggressive comments and flashing you with ethically sourced, reflective rain shells.

### 🎒 Features

#### 🧥 **Drip Cloak** _(Passive)_

Has **advantage on Stealth** when standing near piles of fixed-gear bikes, clothing racks, or discarded espresso cups.

#### 🗣️ **Passive-Aggressive Aura (10 ft radius)**

Creatures that begin their turn in this aura must make a **WIS save (DC 13)** or take **1d4 psychic damage** and have **disadvantage on their next Charisma check**, from the emotional damage of hearing:

> “Oh… that’s an _interesting_ outfit.”  
> “I actually preferred them before they were cool.”  
> “You're drinking _**that**_?”

#### 👟 **Quickstep (1/day)**

Bonus action. The gremlin sprints 60 ft through tight spaces, leaving behind only a trail of overpriced cologne and existential dread. It can pass through enemy spaces without provoking opportunity attacks. Usually used when someone says, _“Name three songs.”_
